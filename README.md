Learning Objectives
1. DOM maniuplation
2. localStorage
3. import export ES6 modules
4. Webpack - used to bundle script files and optimize code.
5. Basic javascript/css (html is done with DOM manipulation through HTMLWebpack plugin)

Things I struggled on
1. This took much longer than anticipated. About 12-14 hours total. A lot of bugs and styling issues.
2. Bugs were hard to find due to the DOM portion being such a large script file.
3. Finding out how to route everything with event listeners and deciding what belongs where.
4. Minimizing code. I copied and pasted too much code that I'm sure could be re-used with slight adjustments.
